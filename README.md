##ckeditor-track-changes

* Track changes plugin for CKEditor, based on [ICE](https://github.com/NYTimes/ice) (NYTimes track changes for TinyMCE). 
* The ICE plugin contains an edited version of ICE, we hope to merge with the ICE repository in the near future.

The code supports all the following functionality:

- Enable / disable track changes mode
- Show / hide track changes
- Accept all changes
- Reject all changes
- Accept a single change
- Reject a single change 
- Display timestamp and user info for each change

##Known Issues
* Adjacent changes from different collaborators may affect each other if you accept/reject a single change in the sequence. This is related to an issue in ICE which we hope to resolve with the developers.
